- 👋 Hi, I’m @DataKen
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithms, healthcare data management and implementing data and artificial intelligence in the African healthcare sector
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Excel, Python and Tableau
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects not necessarily in the healthcare space
- 📫 You can reach me via email on kennethjohnokwok@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love numbers and fantasize about numbers written in different fonts quite often.
